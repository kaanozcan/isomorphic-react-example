  ###Isomorphic React Example

  This is a simple example of isomorphic react application I made to show some general aspects of react.

  ####Stack

  Using Alt.js and react-router-component for simplicity, Webpack for bundling, Babel for ES6 support. Integrated with Reddit Api.

  ####How To

  To run first you need to create a json file named config which has to have a key named port on the root and then run the commands below.

  ```
  npm install
  node bootstrap.js
  ```

  ####Criticize Me

  Yes, do it soon. Do it early. Do it now :)
