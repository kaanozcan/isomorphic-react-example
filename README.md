###Isomorphic React Example

This is a simple example of isomorphic react application I made to show some general aspects of react.

####Stack

Using Alt.js and react-router-component for simplicity, Webpack for bundling, Babel for ES6 support. Integrated with Reddit Api.

####How To

To run first you need to create a json file named config which has to have a key named port on the root and then run the commands below.

```
npm install
node bootstrap.js
```

####Criticize Me

Yes, do it soon. Do it early. Do it now :)
