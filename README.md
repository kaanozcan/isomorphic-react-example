###Isomorphic React Example

This is a simple example of isomorphic react application I made to show some general aspects of react.

####Stack

Using Redux for flux framework, react-router-component for routing, Webpack for bundling, Babel for ES6 support. Integrated with Reddit Api.

####How To  

To run first you need to create a json file named config on root folder which you have to specify port.  

config.json example:  

```
{
  "port": "3000"
}
```

And then run these commands on terminal.
```
npm install  
webpack  
node bootstrap.js  
```
